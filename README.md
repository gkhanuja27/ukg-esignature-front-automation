# UKG eSignature-front Automation

## Pre-requisite:

1. Download any Java IDE. We prefer using IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Requires Java 11.

### Part 1 - Setting up the project:

Open the ukg-esignature-front-automation project in IntelliJ. Import it as a Gradle project.  Also refer to the [Aeon framework repo](http://devgit01.dev.us.corp:7990/projects/VT/repos/aeon/browse).

### Part 2 - How to run a simple test in Chrome:

Now let's run our first test and make sure the correct page opens at runtime. Go to the `SampleTests` class (`src` > `test` > `java` > `tests` > `smoke` > `SampleTests`) and look at how the sample test is structured. 

Now hit the green arrow, SampleTests should run and you should see the test results in the Run tab. 
Also to see the test report, go to (`build` > `reports` > `tests` > `packages` > `tests.smoke.html`) and open it in the browser.
